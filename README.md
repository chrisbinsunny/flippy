## Flippy Usage

### Draggable Flipper
The Draggable Flipper is a versatile flip widget for Flutter that allows you to flip your widgets using both hand gesture and a controller with its various functions. To use the Draggable Flipper, you need to wrap the widgets you want to flip with the `DragFlipper` widget and pass a `controller`.

```dart  
DragFlipper(  
  front: const FrontWidget(),  //required
  back: const BackWidget(),  //required
  controller: flipperController,  //required
  height: double,  
  width: double,  
  padding: EdgeInsets,  
  margin: EdgeInsets,  
  backgroundColor: Color,  
  border: Border,  
  borderRadius: BorderRadius,  
  gradient: Gradient,  
  shape: BoxShape,  
)  
```  

### Regular Flipper
The Regular Flipper is a flip widget for Flutter app that allows you to flip your widgets using a controller with its various functions. Unlike the Draggable Flipper, the Regular Flipper does not support dragging or gestures as a means of flipping the widget. To use the Regular Flipper, you need to wrap the widgets you want to flip with the `RegularFlipper` widget and pass a `controller`.

```dart  
Flipper(  
  front: FrontWidget(),  //required
  back: BackWidget(),  //required
  controller: flipperController,  //required
  height: double,  
  width: double,  
  padding: EdgeInsets,  
  margin: EdgeInsets,  
  backgroundColor: Color,  
  border: Border,  
  borderRadius: BorderRadius,  
  gradient: Gradient,  
  shape: BoxShape,  
)  
```  
## Controller Usage
The FlipperController is a required parameter for both Flipper and DragFlipper. Controller allows you to control the animation of the flipper manually and programmatically. By using the `controller` parameter, you can add programmatic buttons to flip the flipper to the left or right.  
To create a FlipperController, you can use the `FlipperController()` constructor, which accepts a `dragAxis` parameter. The `dragAxis` parameter defaults to `DragAxis.horizontal`, but it can also be set to `DragAxis.vertical` and `DragAxis.both` to change the direction of the flip animation.

```dart  
FlipperController controller= FlipperController(  
  dragAxis: DragAxis.both,  
);
```  
### Methods

The `FlipperController` has three main methods:

-   `flipLeft()`: Flips the flipper to the left for one time. Only works with `DragAxis.horizontal` and `DragAxis.both`.
-   `flipRight()`: Flips the flipper to the right for one time. Only works with `DragAxis.horizontal` and `DragAxis.both`.
-   `flipDown()`: Flips the flipper to the bottom for one time. Only works with `DragAxis.vertical` and `DragAxis.both`.
-    `flipUp()`: Flips the flipper to the top for one time. Only works with `DragAxis.vertical` and `DragAxis.both`.

Please note that the `dragAxis` parameter of the FlipperController determines which flipping functions can be called. If `dragAxis` is set to `DragAxis.vertical`, you can only call `flipDown()` and `flipUp()`. If it is set to `DragAxis.horizontal`, you can only call `flipLeft()` and `flipRight()`.

### Example

Here is an example of how to use the `FlipperController` to add a programmatic button to flip the flipper to the left.
```dart
FlipperController flipperController= FlipperController(  
  dragAxis: DragAxis.horizontal,  
);

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    body: DragFlipper(
      controller: _flipperController,
      front: Text('Front'),
      back: Text('Back'),
    ),
    floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
      onPressed: () => flipperController.flipLeft(),
      child: Icon(Icons.arrow_back),
    ),
  );
} 
```
